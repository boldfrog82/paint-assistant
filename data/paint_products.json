To avoid this a mist coat/full coat technique is recommended. First apply a thin coat of the diluted next coat to fill the pores in the zinc silicate film and a few minutes later apply the same product to full specified film thickness. In case where thinning of the next coat is not desired or in difficult cases, use Transpoxy Sealer 1.99 or Transpoxy Primer 1.16 as a tiecoat.",

In confined spaces, supply an adequate amount of fresh air during application and drying to assist solvent evaporation. Ventilation for this purpose is recommended to be a minimum corresponding to a few air shifts per hour along all surfaces. However, avoid ventilators blowing directly onto the freshly applied paint.",

          "recoating": "The zinc silicate should be fully cured prior to recoating. Un-weathered zinc silicate films are porous and the porosity may vary according to the weather condition during application and the application technique. When recoating zinc silicates, the air in the pores will escape through the new coat of paint and may cause blisters or pinholes ('popping') in the fresh coat just after application. To avoid this a mist coat/full coat technique is recommended. First apply a thin coat of the diluted next coat to fill the pores in the zinc silicate film and a few minutes later apply the same product to full specified film thickness. In case where thinning of the next coat is not desired or in difficult cases, use Transpoxy Sealer 1.99 or Transpoxy Primer 1.16 as a tiecoat.",
          "application_conditions": "The optimal conditions for spraying are between 15-25 °C and 75% RH. Minimum surface temperature during application should be 0°C. Steel temperature has to be above the dew point. As a rule of thumb a steel temperature 3°C above the dew point can be considered safe. The maximum temperature is approx. 50°C. When applying at steel temperatures higher than 30 °C, care should be taken to avoid dry-spray. This can be done by using more Thinner 6.07 (up to 10%) or by using Thinner 6.08 which is slower evaporating thinner than Thinner 6.07. Please note that sagging resistance may be reduced and therefore reduction of wet film thickness may be necessary. In confined spaces, supply an adequate amount of fresh air during application and drying to assist solvent evaporation. Ventilation for this purpose is recommended to be a minimum corresponding to a few air shifts per hour along all surfaces. However, avoid ventilators blowing directly onto the freshly applied paint.",
          "maximum_dry_film_thickness": "Excessive application of the paint will lead to mud cracking. It is advised to use the recommended dry film thickness of 75 microns. Above thicknesses of 100 microns, mud cracking can occur.",
          "curing_conditions": "Transozinc Silicate requires humidity for full curing. At a RH of 50% or higher, typical minimum recoating interval at 0° C is 24 hours, at 20° 12 hours and at 40 °C approx. 4 hours. Relative Humidity should be monitored during the curing process. At lower humidity, the curing may be accelerated by gently sprinkling with fresh water or a 0,5% ammonia solution. This should only be done after an initial curing of 6 hours. Curing can be checked by using the MEK rub test according to ASTM 4752. After 50 double rubs with a cloth soaked in MEK, the zinc silicate coating should not dissolve. In case MEK is not available, thinner 6.07 or thinner 6.08 may be used alternatively."

In case MEK is not available, Transocean Thinner 6.07 or Thinner 6.08 may be used alternatively. Un weathered zinc silicate films are porous and the porosity may vary according to the weather condition during application and the application technique. When recoating, the air in the pores will escape through the new coat of paint and may cause blisters or pinholes ('popping') in the coat just after application. To avoid this a mist coat/full coat technique is recommended. First apply a thin coat of thinned Transpoxy Primer (use 10-30 % Transocean Thinner 6.03) to fill the pores in the zinc silicate film. The amount of thinner required depends on various conditions such as level of porosity in the zinc silicate as well as local conditions.

          "description": "Transpoxy Masterbond BT is a high solids primer/coating with excellent anticorrosive properties under severe corrosive conditions. The product has an increased tolerance to damp substrates and can be used at temperatures down to 0°C. Transpoxy Masterbond BT offers good adhesion to blast cleaned steel, weathered (shop) primers as well as a variety of aged coatings. In maintenance conditions it tolerates a lower degree of surface preparation and can be used in combination with mechanical power tooling or high pressure water jetting as surface preparation. Due to its phenolic functional epoxy-amine crosslinking, the products offers good chemical resistance against various fuels and hydrocarbons. The product carries various (system) approvals from oil companies and is an approved coating according to IMO- PSPC for usage in Crude Oil - and Ballast tanks.",

Allow ventilation during and after application of the coating system. Temperature of the ventilation air should lie between 20°C and 35°C. Continue ventilation until the system has fully cured.\nForced cure guidelines:\n- ventilate for 4 hours with ambient air followed by 4 hours with hot air to reach a surface temperature of 80 °C.\nOr alternatively:\n- ventilate for 2 hours with ambient air followed by 10 hours with warm air to reach a surface temperature of 55°C.\nDo not apply the coating when ambient temperature will be less than 12°C for more than 48 hours after application of the coating.\nIf at any time, a greasy appearing film is observed on the surface of the coating, the surface should be thoroughly wiped with clean rags saturated in Transocean Epoxy Thinner 6.03 or Transocean Cleaner 6.13. Allow evaporation of the solvent before recoating.\nFor coating of internals of tanks or areas not exposed to direct sunlight, the maximum recoating times can be extended to 14-30 days, dependent on conditions.

Spread a nylon/thin plastic wrapping paper over the wet painted surface and shrink it by hand with a little pressure. Carefully remove the nylon/thin plastic wrapping paper from the wet surface so as to leave the pattern on the surface.
