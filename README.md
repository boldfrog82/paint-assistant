# Paint Quotation Generator

An interactive Streamlit application for building customer quotations using the National Paints product catalogue and price list. The tool lets sales teams search the catalogue, add products with pack sizes, apply optional discounts, and export quotations as CSV or PDF files. Totals automatically include the mandatory 5% VAT.

## Getting started

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Streamlit app**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
   ```
   The interface opens in your browser. Use the sidebar to enter customer details, search for paint products, and add them to the quotation.

## Data files

The app reads two JSON datasets stored in the `data/` directory:

- `paint_products.json` – descriptive product catalogue.
- `pricelistnationalpaints.json` – pricing information grouped by category.

When updating these files, validate them against their JSON Schemas to avoid runtime errors:

```bash
python scripts/validate_data.py
```

Both schema definitions live in `schemas/`.

## Testing

Run unit tests to verify the quotation maths:

```bash
pytest
```

## Web UI (Streamlit)

Launch the quotation interface locally with:

```bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

The browser UI lets you:

- search the catalogue with instant suggestions and select the right pack size
- enter quantities and optional discounts for each line item
- review running subtotals with 5% VAT automatically applied
- download the current quotation as CSV or export a simple PDF invoice

## Static HTML quotation builder

If you would rather open the tool as a plain HTML page (without running Streamlit), use the standalone front end in `web/index.html`:

1. Serve the repository directory so the page can load the JSON price lists (browsers block `file://` fetches). From the project root run:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
2. Open <http://localhost:8000/web/index.html> in your browser.

The static page loads the same product catalogue and price list, offers Google-style search suggestions, and lets you pick pack sizes, quantities, and discounts. It calculates subtotals with 5% VAT, supports removing rows, and includes buttons to download the quote as CSV or print/save the page as PDF.

## Google Colab setup

To explore the quotation tool inside Google Colab, run the following cells in
order. Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with the actual account (or organisation)
that hosts the repository before executing the first command. Leaving the angle
brackets in place causes the shell to look for a file called
`YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME`, which triggers the "No such file or directory"
message shown in the screenshot.

**Cell 1 – Clone the repository**

```python
repo_url = input("Enter the HTTPS clone URL of your paint-assistant repository: ").strip()
!git clone "$repo_url"
%cd paint-assistant
```

When prompted, paste the full HTTPS address of the repository you want to use
and press Enter (for example,
`https://github.com/your-company/paint-assistant.git`). This avoids the
"could not read Username" error that appears when a placeholder URL is left
unchanged. If the project is private, supply a Personal Access Token as part of
the URL, such as `https://<TOKEN>@github.com/your-company/paint-assistant.git`.

**Cell 2 – Install dependencies (plus pyngrok for tunnelling)**

```python
!pip install -q -r requirements.txt pyngrok
```

**Cell 3 – (Optional) run tests**

```python
!pytest
```

**Cell 4 – Configure Streamlit for Colab**

```python
import os

os.environ["STREAMLIT_SERVER_HEADLESS"] = "true"
os.environ["STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT"] = "8501"
os.environ["STREAMLIT_SERVER_ADDRESS"] = "0.0.0.0"
```

**Cell 5 – Launch the Streamlit app**

```python
!streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py &>/dev/null &
```

**Cell 6 – (First time only) authenticate ngrok**

```python
from getpass import getpass
from pyngrok import ngrok

authtoken = getpass("Paste only your ngrok authtoken (visit dashboard.ngrok.com to generate one): ").strip()
if authtoken:
    if authtoken.startswith("http"):
        raise ValueError("The ngrok authtoken is a short string (no https://). Copy just the token shown on your dashboard.")
    ngrok.set_auth_token(authtoken)
```

You must sign up for a free ngrok account and supply the personal authtoken
displayed at <https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken>. Copy just
the token characters—pasting the entire URL causes ngrok to raise
`ERR_NGROK_105` because the value does not look like a valid authtoken. Without
any token, ngrok returns the `ERR_NGROK_4018` authentication error shown in Colab.

**Cell 7 – Open an ngrok tunnel and display the public URL**

```python
from pyngrok.exception import PyngrokNgrokError

try:
    public_url = ngrok.connect(8501, "http")
    public_url
except PyngrokNgrokError as exc:
    print("ngrok could not open the tunnel:", exc)
    print("Double-check that your account is verified and that you pasted only the authtoken string.")
```

If ngrok logs lines that begin with `ERROR:pyngrok...`, treat them as
diagnostic output rather than Python commands—do not copy those log lines into
another cell. Instead, resolve the authentication issue (usually by confirming
your ngrok e-mail address and reinstalling the authtoken) and rerun the cell.

Visit the returned link to interact with the quotation builder. When you are
finished, disconnect the tunnel and stop Streamlit:

```python
ngrok.disconnect(public_url.public_url)
!killall streamlit
```

### Troubleshooting Streamlit in Colab

If the ngrok tunnel opens but the public page shows an error (for example,
`ERR_NGROK_8012`), verify that Streamlit is actually running on port 8501 before
retrying:

1. **Confirm you are inside the repository and the app file exists**
   ```python
   %cd /content/paint-assistant
   !ls -lah
   !ls -lah app
   ```

2. **Run Streamlit's sample app to confirm the runtime works**
   ```python
   !streamlit hello
   ```
   If this fails, reinstall the requirements (including `pyngrok` and
   `streamlit`) and rerun the hello app.

   ```python
   !pip install -q -r requirements.txt pyngrok streamlit
   ```

3. **Start your application with logs visible**
   ```python
   !streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py --server.port=8501 --server.address=0.0.0.0
   ```
   Leave this cell running while you inspect the output. Fix any missing module
   or file path errors that appear in the logs. When the server is ready,
   Streamlit prints a local URL such as `http://0.0.0.0:8501`.

4. **Open the ngrok tunnel in a new cell after Streamlit is running**
   ```python
   from pyngrok import ngrok

   public_url = ngrok.connect(8501)
   print("Public URL:", public_url)
   ```

   You can confirm the listener exists with:

   ```python
   !ss -ltnp | grep 8501
   ```

   If you previously launched a broken background process, stop it and try
   again:

   ```python
   !pkill -f "streamlit run" || True
   ```

   Unsure about the app path? List the available Streamlit files:

   ```python
   !find . -maxdepth 3 -iname "*streamlit*.py"
   ```

Once the Streamlit logs show the server is running and `ss` reports a listener on
`0.0.0.0:8501`, the ngrok link will load the quotation builder correctly.

## Command-line quotation tool

If you prefer working in the terminal, run the interactive helper:

```bash
python quotation_tool.py
```

The script lets you type a product name to receive Google-style suggestions,
choose the pack size (drum, gallon, litre, etc.), apply an optional discount,
and automatically calculates the subtotal, VAT (5%), and grand total for the
quotation.

# paint-assistant

This repository contains supporting data for National Paints products together
with a lightweight interactive quotation builder.

## Quotation Builder

Run the tool from the repository root:

```
python quotation_tool.py
```

Features:

- Type part of a product name and receive instant suggestions similar to a
  search engine auto-complete.
- Choose the desired pack size (drum, gallon, litre, etc.) and quantity.
- Apply an optional per-line discount before VAT.
- Automatically calculates the subtotal, total discount, VAT (5%), and the
  grand total for the quotation.

The script reads prices from `pricelistnationalpaints.json`, so keep that file
up to date to reflect the latest pricing.
