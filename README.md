# paint-assistant

Tools and datasets for exploring National Paints products.

## Running tests

The project uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for automated testing. To
run the test suite, install the project's Python dependencies (if any) and
execute:

```bash
pytest
```

The tests exercise the JSON loading helpers and the validation utilities for
detecting duplicate product codes.
